        <p class="left-font"><b>When will I get my airtime reward?</b></p>
        <p class="left-font">Airtime is disbursed on a Monday</p>

        <p class="left-font"><b>How much is my airtime reward?</b></p>
        <p class="left-font">R5</p>

        <p class="left-font"><b>My answer was not presented as an option. What does this mean? </b></p>
        <p class="left-font">There is a discussion box below every challenge. Send us a message if you don’t think the correct answer has been displayed. Tell us what you think the answer should be and we’ll look into it for you.</p>

        <p class="left-font"><b>I chose the right answer but it says I got it wrong.</b></p>
        <p class="left-font">There is a discussion box below every challenge. Send us a message saying that you think that the answer is incorrect, what you think the answer should be, and we will look into it for you</p>

        <p class="left-font"><b>Can my friend join?</b></p>

        <p class="left-font"><b>Why are there only 3 questions per day?</b></p>
        <p class="left-font">Because consistent practice throughout the year is the best way to revise maths (and we want to make it manageable as we know you have a lot of other homework)</p>

        <p class="left-font"><b>What if I miss a day?</b></p>
        <p class="left-font">That's ok, you can answer the challenges you missed the next day. But the system is reset on a Sunday, so answer all outstanding questions on Saturday.</p>
